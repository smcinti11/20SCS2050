Code for CS 2050 (Computer Science II), Spring 2020

This repository has code shared with my students in CS 2050 (Computer Science II), Spring 2020, at MSU Denver. This course, a continuation of CS 1050 (Computer Science I), further emphasizes the concepts of the software development cycle and introduces the concept of an abstract data type (ADT). The topics covered include linked-lists, trees, stacks, queues, classes, recursion, and a variety of data representation methods. Further topics in software engineering and programming style as well as algorithms for sorting and searching are included.
